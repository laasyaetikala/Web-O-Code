=>Problems faced and Solutions
Handling Grids and Carousels went tough while managing the orientation of certain components, making the website responsive was a little challenging, then referring the documentation we corrected ourselves and got our concepts clear.

=>Learning new things
We learnt how to make a slideshow of images with the help of carousels and also learnt dealing with github.
